# Unity WebGL Build Files for Production

For production deployment, you must serve the Unity WebGL files with correct filenames and Content-Encoding headers.

## Required files in this folder:
- build.loader.js
- build.framework.js
- build.data
- build.wasm
- (optionally) their .br precompressed versions for Brotli

## Production server setup:
- If using Nginx, Apache, or similar, configure the server to serve .js, .wasm, .data files with `Content-Encoding: br` if the `.br` version exists and the client supports Brotli.
- If you use a static host (Netlify, Vercel, S3, etc.), upload both compressed and uncompressed files, and set headers as needed.
- For local development, decompress .br files to their original names (see decompress_build.js script).

## Example Nginx config:
```
location /Build/ {
    add_header Content-Encoding br;
    try_files $uri $uri.br =404;
}
```

## React build:
- Ensure the Build folder is present in `public/` before running `npm run build`.
- The React build will copy all files from `public/` to `build/`.
- After build, deploy the contents of `build/` to your production server.

## UnityPlayer.js
- The loader expects files at `/Build/build.loader.js`, `/Build/build.framework.js`, `/Build/build.data`, `/Build/build.wasm`.
- If you see `Unexpected token '<'`, the file is missing or being served as HTML (check your server config).

## Summary
- For production: serve both compressed and uncompressed files, set Content-Encoding headers, and ensure correct filenames.
- For development: decompress .br files to their original names.
