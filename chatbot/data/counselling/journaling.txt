Reflective & Structured Journaling
---------------------------------
Benefits:
- Externalizes spiraling thoughts
- Tracks patterns (sleep, mood, triggers)
- Clarifies values and priority shifts

Formats:
1. Thought Record (CBT)
   Situation | Emotion (0-100%) | Automatic Thought | Evidence For | Evidence Against | Balanced Thought | Action
2. Gratitude List: 3 specific items (avoid generic wording)
3. Emotion Log: Time, Emotion, Intensity, Trigger, Skill Used, Result
4. Values Alignment: What mattered today? Did actions align? What is one small adjustment tomorrow?
5. Worry Box: Write the worry, schedule a 10-min worry period later; defer until then.

Tips:
- Keep entries brief (2–5 min) to lower resistance.
- Re-read weekly to extract patterns instead of daily rumination.
- Pair with habit stacking (journal right after evening teeth brushing).
- Use objective language: replace "always/never" with timelines ("3 times this week").
