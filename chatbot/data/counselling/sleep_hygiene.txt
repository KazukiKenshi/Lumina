Sleep Hygiene & Stabilization
-----------------------------
Goals: Improve sleep quality, shorten sleep onset latency, reduce night-time awakenings.

Core Principles:
- Consistent wake time (anchor circadian rhythm) even after poor sleep.
- Light exposure: Bright natural light within 30–60 minutes of waking.
- Caffeine cut-off: ~8 hours before target bedtime.
- Screen wind-down: 45–60 minutes pre-sleep (use low contrast tasks: stretching, paper reading).
- Bed = Sleep & intimacy only (remove work/gaming associations).
- Pre-sleep ritual (15–20 min): dim lights, gentle movement, breathing.

Environmental:
- Cool temperature (18–20°C / 64–68°F optimal range).
- Dark (blackout curtains / eye mask) & quiet (white/pink noise if helpful).
- Comfortable mattress & pillow alignment.

Cognitive Strategies:
- If awake > 20 min: leave bed, do neutral activity (no phone scrolling) until drowsy.
- Thought parking: jot intrusive thoughts on a notepad; tell brain "handled tomorrow".
- Avoid clock-checking; remove visible digital clocks.

Recovery After Bad Night:
- Avoid long daytime naps (>30 min); if needed, power nap early afternoon.
- Keep wake time consistent; resist sleeping in >1 hour.

Progress Tracking:
- Use a 2-week sleep diary (bedtime, wake time, perceived sleep quality, number of awakenings).
- Adjust behaviors based on recurring patterns (e.g., late intense exercise shifts sleep onset).
