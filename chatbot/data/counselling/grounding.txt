Grounding Techniques
--------------------
Purpose: Re-anchor awareness during anxiety, dissociation, or racing thoughts.

Sensory (5-4-3-2-1):
- 5 things you can see
- 4 things you can touch
- 3 things you can hear
- 2 things you can smell
- 1 thing you can taste

Physical:
- Press feet firmly into the floor (notice pressure distribution)
- Hold an ice cube or run hands under cool water
- Progressive muscle tension then release (hands, shoulders, jaw)

Cognitive:
- Count backwards from 100 by 7s
- Name cities or foods alphabetically
- Describe your environment factually (color, shape, temperature)

Breath Anchor:
- Inhale 4s, hold 2s, exhale 6s (elongate exhale to engage parasympathetic system)

Emergency Mini-Routine:
1. Name current emotion.
2. State: "I am safe in this moment." (if true)
3. Do one sensory + one physical grounding action.
4. Slow breathing for 60 seconds.

Use proactively before overwhelm escalates.
