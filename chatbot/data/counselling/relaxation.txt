Relaxation & Down-Regulation
---------------------------
Goal: Shift physiology from sympathetic (fight/flight) toward parasympathetic (rest/digest).

Breathing:
- Box breath: 4 in / 4 hold / 4 out / 4 hold (repeat 4 cycles)
- Extended exhale: In 4 / out 8 (signals vagal activation)

Progressive Muscle Release:
1. Tense one muscle group 5–7s
2. Release and notice contrast 10–15s
3. Sequence: hands, arms, shoulders, jaw, face, stomach, legs, feet

Visualization:
- Safe place imagery (rich sensory details)
- Future coping success scenario (imagine skill execution smoothly)

Auditory:
- Neutral ambient background (rain, ocean, brown noise)
- Guided relaxation script (10–15 min)

Stacking:
Combine: breathing + visualization + gentle stretch for amplified effect.

Integration:
- Schedule micro-relaxation breaks every 2–3 hours.
- Track which technique reduces anxiety fastest (log onset/offset ratings).
