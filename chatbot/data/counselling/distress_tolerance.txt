Distress Tolerance (Short-Term Crisis Skills)
-------------------------------------------
Purpose: Survive intense emotional waves without making things worse.

Core Modules:
- ACCEPTS (Activities, Contribute, Comparisons, Emotions, Push away, Thoughts, Sensations)
- TIP (Temperature change, Intense exercise, Paced breathing)
- Self-soothing (engage the 5 senses deliberately)
- Distraction with structure (time-boxed tasks: 10-min tidy, sort emails)

ACCEPTS Examples:
Activities: Brief walk, puzzle, light chore.
Contribute: Send a supportive message to a friend.
Comparisons: Recall previous challenge survived.
Emotions: Watch a short uplifting clip.
Push Away: Mentally shelve the issue for 15 minutes.
Thoughts: Count tiles, solve a mini math series.
Sensations: Hold warm mug, cold compress.

TIP Sequence:
1. Splash face with cold water / hold cool pack (20–30s)
2. 1–2 minutes of moderately intense movement (stairs, brisk march)
3. Slow breathing: In 4s / out 6–7s.

Rules:
- Use DT skills when problem cannot be solved immediately.
- Transition to problem-solving once emotional intensity <60%.
- Avoid overuse (not for chronic avoidance).
