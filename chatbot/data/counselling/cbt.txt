Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)
----------------------------------
CBT helps identify and challenge negative thought patterns.

Steps:
1. Identify cognitive distortions (all-or-nothing thinking, overgeneralization, catastrophizing)
2. Examine evidence for and against these thoughts
3. Replace with balanced, realistic thoughts
4. Behavioral activation: schedule positive activities even when unmotivated

CBT is evidence-based for depression, anxiety, and OCD.
