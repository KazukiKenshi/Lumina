Emotion Regulation (DBT/General)
---------------------------------
Goals:
- Understand emotions as signals, not threats.
- Reduce vulnerability to intense swings.

Core Skills:
1. Identify: Name the emotion (use a feelings list if unsure).
2. Validate: Acknowledge it makes sense given the context.
3. Allow: Permit the emotion to be present without suppression.
4. Modulate: Use skills to shift intensity (see below).

Reduce Vulnerability (PLEASE):
- Physical health basics (sleep, nutrition, movement)
- Avoid mood-altering substances
- Balanced eating & hydration
- Exercise (moderate, consistent)
- Treat illness/pain
- Embrace routine & structure

Modulation Techniques:
- Opposite action (do the behavior opposite to the urge if emotion is unjustified)
- Check the facts (is the emotion intensity proportional to reality?)
- Paired breathing (slow exhale longer than inhale)
- Temperature shift (cold water splash; activates dive reflex)

Tips:
- Emotions peak then subside like a wave; surf them instead of fighting.
- Track triggers and recovery times in a log.
- Prevent overload by scheduling micro-regulation breaks (90 seconds of mindful breathing).
