Interpersonal Effectiveness (Skills for Relationships)
----------------------------------------------------
Objectives:
- Ask for what you need clearly.
- Say no without excessive guilt.
- Maintain self-respect while preserving relationships.

DEAR Assertion Format (DBT variant):
D Describe facts (just observable data)
E Express feelings / impact
A Ask specifically for what you need (or state what you are declining)
R Reinforce (benefits of complying / mutual gain)

GIVE (for relationship maintenance):
G Gentle tone & body language
I Interested listening (reflect back key points)
V Validate emotional perspective ("It makes sense you feel...")
E Easy manner (humor, warmth, calm pacing)

FAST (for self-respect):
F Fair (to self and other)
A (Don’t) Apologize unnecessarily
S Stick to values
T Truthful (avoid exaggeration/manipulation)

Boundary Examples:
- "I can’t take that on this week." (clear, no over-explaining)
- "I need some quiet time; I’ll rejoin in 20 minutes."
- "I prefer discussing serious topics earlier in the evening."

Conflict Tips:
- Use "temporarily true" framing: "Right now I feel overwhelmed; can we pause?"
- Separate intent from impact when resolving misunderstandings.
- Anchor conversations to shared goals (e.g., trust, calm coexistence).
