Self-Compassion & Internal Dialogue
----------------------------------
Principles (Kristin Neff inspired):
- Mindfulness: Notice suffering without fusion or suppression.
- Common Humanity: Others struggle similarly; you are not uniquely broken.
- Kindness: Speak to self as you would a friend.

Reframing Script:
1. Observation: "This is a moment of difficulty."
2. Normalization: "Struggle is part of being human."
3. Support: "May I be patient and gentle with myself right now."

Harsh Inner Voice Disputation:
- Identify exaggerated judgment ("I ruined everything").
- Replace with proportional statement ("This setback is frustrating, but fixable.").
- Add learning lens: "What’s one thing I can adjust next time?"

Compassion Break (1–2 min):
- Hand over heart or gentle pressure on sternum
- Slow exhale while repeating kind phrase

Practice Anchors:
- Attach to existing routines: after meals, before bed.
- Journal 1 compassionate phrase daily responding to a challenge.

Avoid:
- Pseudo-compassion that excuses harmful behavior; aim for accountability + warmth.
