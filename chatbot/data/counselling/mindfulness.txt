Mindfulness and Acceptance
--------------------------
- Be present: non-judgmental awareness of the moment
- Observe thoughts without reacting
- Practice mindful breathing and body scans
- Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT): accept difficult emotions while taking meaningful action
- Defusion: notice thoughts as mental events, not facts

Mindfulness reduces rumination and stress.
