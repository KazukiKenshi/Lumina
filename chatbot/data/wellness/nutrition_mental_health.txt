Key Influences:
- Stable blood glucose (balanced meals) supports mood regulation.
- Omega-3 fatty acids (e.g., fatty fish, flax) associated with reduced depressive symptoms.
- B vitamins & iron support energy and cognitive clarity.
- Hydration: Mild dehydration can mimic fatigue and poor focus.
- Fermented foods & fiber feed gut microbiome (potential mood link).

Balanced Plate Guide:
- Protein + complex carbs + healthy fat + colorful produce.
- Time consistent meals to prevent energy crashes.

Mindful Eating:
- Pause before eating: check hunger vs emotion.
- Slow pace: set utensil down between bites.
- Distinguish physical hunger from stress-triggered urges.

Support Prompts:
- Encourage gradual changes (1 meal upgrade per day).
- Suggest tracking mood-energy vs meals for pattern insight.
