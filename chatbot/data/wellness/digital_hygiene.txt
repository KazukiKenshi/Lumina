Digital Hygiene & Mental Space
------------------------------
Common Strains:
- Endless scrolling fragments attention.
- Late-night blue light delays sleep onset.
- Constant notifications elevate baseline stress.

Core Practices:
1. Notification audit: Disable non-essential push alerts.
2. App zoning: Place high-distraction apps on a secondary screen/folder.
3. Time windows: Define intentional check-in blocks (e.g., messages at :00 and :30 marks).
4. Screen curfew: 45+ minutes pre-sleep transition to low-stimulation tasks.
5. Single-task mode: Fullscreen windows; hide other tabs while focused.

Detox Mini-Rest:
- 10 min analog interval (walk, stretch, paper reading) every 2 hours.
- Weekly 2–4 hour intentional offline block.

Reflection Prompt:
- "Did this digital action serve my goals or fragment them?" Adjust tomorrow accordingly.
