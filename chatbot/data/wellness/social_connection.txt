Social Connection & Psychological Wellbeing
------------------------------------------
Dimensions:
- Emotional support (empathy, validation)
- Practical support (tangible help)
- Belonging (shared identity/activities)
- Intimacy (mutual disclosure & trust)

Strengthening Steps:
1. Initiate micro-interactions (brief check-ins, shared humor).
2. Express specific appreciation (name concrete helpful action).
3. Schedule recurring connection rituals (weekly call, monthly meetup).
4. Diversify sources (friends, community groups, interest clubs).

Loneliness Interventions:
- Shift from evaluation ("Do they like me?") to curiosity ("What matters to them?").
- Volunteer or contribution acts to foster purpose linkage.
- Limit passive social media comparison; prioritize active exchanges.

Boundary + Connection Balance:
- Say no to preserve energy; use "not now, later?" framing for postponement.
- Share needs early before resentment accumulates.
