Resilience & Adaptive Coping
----------------------------
Components:
- Realistic optimism (acknowledge difficulty + possibility of improvement)
- Cognitive flexibility (multiple perspectives, alternatives)
- Emotional regulation capacity
- Social support access
- Purpose/values linkage

Skill Practices:
1. Situation Reframing: Identify controllable vs uncontrollable elements; act on controllable.
2. Micro-goal setting: Convert vague aim ("be better") into today's actionable ("walk 10 minutes").
3. Stress Inoculation: Gradually expose to manageable challenge + recovery cycle.
4. Values Check: Weekly note of actions aligned/misaligned with core values.
5. Self-Monitor Recovery: Track time from stress spike to baseline; seek patterns.

Growth Mindset Prompts:
- "What did this setback teach about my process?"
- "Which skill improved marginally this week?"

Warning Signs of Strain:
- Shrinking social contact, chronic rumination, abandoning restorative routines.

Support Prompts:
- Encourage early course-correction rather than waiting for collapse.
- Highlight small wins; quantify progress when possible.
