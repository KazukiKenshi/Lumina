Physical Activity & Mood Regulation
----------------------------------
Mechanisms:
- Endorphin & endocannabinoid release -> improved affect.
- Increased BDNF -> neuroplasticity support.
- Modulates stress reactivity (lower baseline cortisol over time).

Minimum Effective Dose:
- Light movement breaks every 60–90 min (stretch, brief walk).
- 2–3 sessions/week moderate cardio (20–30 min).
- Strength/resistance 2x/week for metabolic + functional benefits.

Motivation Aids:
- Pair movement with existing pleasant stimulus (music, outdoors).
- Track subjective energy pre/post for reinforcement.
- Focus on consistency > intensity early.

Low-Energy Strategy:
- "Movement ramp": start with 2 minutes; if still exhausted, rest without guilt.
- Gentle mobility sequence on overwhelmed days (neck, shoulders, hips).
