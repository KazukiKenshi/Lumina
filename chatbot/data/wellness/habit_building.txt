Habit Building & Behavior Change
-------------------------------
Principles:
- Start tiny (action <2 minutes) to reduce friction.
- Anchor new habits to existing routines (after morning tea: 5 mindful breaths).
- Environment design beats motivation; remove blockers, place cues visibly.

Cycle:
Cue -> Action -> Reward -> Reflection (adjust difficulty or timing).

Tracking:
- Binary habit log (did/did not) prevents perfectionism.
- Weekly review: keep, modify, or drop habits based on usefulness.

Plateau Handling:
- Add slight progression (e.g., +1 minute, +1 rep) when habit feels automatic.
- If resistance grows, shrink back to minimum version.

Avoid:
- All-or-nothing streak mindset; treat missed day as data.
