Adult ADHD Indicators
---------------------
Core Domains:
1. Inattention: Disorganization, losing items, difficulty sustaining focus, careless mistakes.
2. Hyperactivity/Impulsivity: Restlessness (internal), fidgeting, interrupting, difficulty waiting turns.

Adult Presentation Nuances:
- Hyperactivity may appear as mental racing or task switching instead of overt physical movement.
- Masking strategies (lists, alarms) partially compensate but fail under stress.
- Executive dysfunction: initiation delay, time blindness, inconsistent follow-through.

Functional Impact Areas:
- Work: missed deadlines, inconsistent productivity.
- Relationships: perceived inattentiveness during conversation.
- Daily life: clutter accumulation, unfinished projects.

Differential Points:
- Distinguish from anxiety (ADHD: distractibility across contexts vs worry-focused).
- Differentiate depression-related concentration issues (episodic vs chronic pattern).

Support Prompts:
- Encourage structured external supports (calendar blocking, visual boards).
- Break tasks into tiny actionable steps (2–5 minute starters).
- Suggest professional assessment for formal diagnosis & treatment planning.
