Panic Disorder Indicators
-------------------------
Core Feature:
- Recurrent unexpected panic attacks (abrupt surge of intense fear/discomfort peaking within minutes).

Common Panic Attack Symptoms:
- Palpitations, pounding heart, tachycardia
- Sweating
- Trembling or shaking
- Shortness of breath / smothering
- Feelings of choking
- Chest pain or discomfort
- Nausea or abdominal distress
- Dizziness, light-headedness
- Chills or heat sensations
- Paresthesias
- Derealization or depersonalization
- Fear of losing control or "going crazy"
- Fear of dying

Associated Criteria:
- Persistent worry about additional attacks or consequences.
- Significant maladaptive behavior changes (avoidance of exercise, unfamiliar places, leaving home alone).

Differential Points:
- Rule out medical causes (cardiac, endocrine) especially in first episodes.
- Differentiate from social anxiety (panic is not limited to performance or social situations).

Support Prompts:
- Normalize physical intensity as non-dangerous.
- Encourage graded exposure & interoceptive exercises.
- Suggest breathing regulation (avoid fast shallow hyperventilation).
