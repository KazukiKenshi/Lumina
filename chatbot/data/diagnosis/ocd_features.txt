Obsessive-Compulsive Features (OCD)
----------------------------------
Core Components:
- Obsessions: Intrusive, recurrent thoughts, images, urges causing anxiety/distress.
- Compulsions: Repetitive behaviors or mental acts aimed at reducing distress or preventing feared outcome.

Common Themes:
- Contamination, symmetry/exactness, harm, taboo intrusive thoughts (sexual, religious, aggressive), checking.

Functional Indicators:
- Time consumption (>1 hour/day) or significant distress/impairment.
- Attempts to suppress/neutralize thoughts.
- Ego-dystonic nature of intrusive content (recognized as unwanted).

Differential Points:
- Distinguish from generalized worry (OCD: specific intrusive images/rituals).
- Different from psychosis (OCD: insight usually partially preserved).

Support Prompts:
- Validate distress while reframing mental events as non-dangerous.
- Encourage evidence-based treatment (exposure and response prevention, CBT).
- Discourage reassurance rituals through gentle limit-setting.
