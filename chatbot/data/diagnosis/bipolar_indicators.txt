Bipolar Spectrum Indicators
---------------------------
Mood Episode Types:
- Depressive: Similar to unipolar depression (low mood, anhedonia, sleep/appetite change).
- Hypomanic: Elevated/irritable mood + increased activity lasting >=4 days without marked impairment (no psychosis).
- Manic: Elevated/irritable + functional impairment, possible psychosis, hospitalization risk.

Key Hypo/Manic Features:
- Decreased need for sleep (feels rested on little sleep)
- Pressured speech, flight of ideas
- Grandiosity / inflated self-esteem
- Increased goal-directed activity or psychomotor agitation
- Risky behaviors (spending sprees, impulsive sex, investments)

Screening Clues:
- Antidepressant activation (mood elevation beyond baseline)
- Cyclical mood history (periods of unusually high energy vs crashes)
- Family history of bipolar disorder

Differential Considerations:
- Distinguish ADHD (lifelong pattern) vs episodic elevated mood.
- Rule out substance-induced mood changes.

Support Prompts:
- Track sleep, energy, spending, impulsivity early.
- Encourage professional evaluation before med changes.
- Promote mood stabilizing routines (consistent sleep/wake, reduced stimulation at night).
