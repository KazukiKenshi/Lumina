Post-Traumatic Stress Indicators (PTSD)
--------------------------------------
Context: Exposure to actual/threatened death, serious injury, or sexual violence (direct, witnessed, learned about, or repeated indirect exposure).

Clusters:
1. Intrusion: Unwanted memories, nightmares, flashbacks, psychological distress at cues.
2. Avoidance: Efforts to avoid thoughts, feelings, conversations, places, reminders.
3. Negative Cognitions/Mood: Detachment, persistent negative beliefs ("I am ruined"), blame, diminished interest.
4. Arousal/Reactivity: Hypervigilance, exaggerated startle, irritability/anger, concentration problems, sleep disturbance.

Screening Notes:
- Symptoms persist >1 month.
- Clinically significant distress/impairment.
- Differentiate from acute stress (duration <1 month).
- Rule out substance effects and TBI symptom overlap.

Support Prompts:
- Normalize adaptive survival responses.
- Encourage gradual, supported exposure and grounding.
- Suggest professional evaluation for persistent functional impairment.
